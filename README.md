# Hungarian Officers
This repository contains data and R scripts for an ongoing study of the tenure of barons in office in medieval Hungary. The study engages with the theory articulated by Elemér Mályusz and Pál Engel, which posits a direct link between castle ownership and political power. According to this established view, the history of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary is divided into two distinct periods: one characterized by predominantly royal control over castles, and the other by predominantly aristocratic control. These phases are thought to correspond to periods of strong and weak royal authority and to reflect the gradual weakening of the state, culminating in its collapse at the beginning of the sixteenth century. Preliminary results from an initial series of analyses of variance and multilevel survival models show little support for this interpretation. Instead, they suggest that kings possessed similar capacities to redistribute political roles within the kingdom regardless of castle ownership. These findings complement the recent critique put forward by Tamás Pálosfalvi in 'Monarchia vagy rendi állam? Gondolatok a késő középkori magyar állam jellegéről', _Századok_ 154 (2020): 135-182.
